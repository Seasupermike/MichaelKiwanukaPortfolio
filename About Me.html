                Hello, I am Michael Kiwanuka. I'm a sophomore and will graduate in 2027. I go to the laboratory school of finance and technology. Was born in New York. I'm good with numbers, detail oriented and a hard worker. I know how to use the unity game engine to make video games, I can also use blender to make simple 3D models. I also know how to make basic websites using HTML & CSS. By the end of this year I want to know how to use javascript. When I graduate high school I want to go to college and get a degree in computer science. Long term I want to work for a game development company. I was inspired to be a game developer when I started watching minecraft modding videos. I wanted to learn how to make mods myself and that got me into programming using scratch. One thing that shows my skills is the game development class I take on saturdays. While we work alone we help each other out when we get stuck on a problem. One funny story is when one of my friends accidentally removed a letter from her code and had error lines everywhere. I noticed her mistake and she fixed the problem. If I was working with a team in a company I would notice minor mistakes before they spiral into larger problems.
